Itâ€™s a very basic chat room that just lets you talk to a group of people. I used the socket.io website to help guide me through the process of making the index.is and script file work with one another. 
The challenges I faced were trying to understand the socket.io library and and how to pass message back and fourth. Also displaying the message to the user took me a while to figure out. 
Another challenge I faced was getting the index.js to load the style sheet and java script for the index.html
